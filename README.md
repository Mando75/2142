*****************************************************
* Install instructions
*****************************************************
FIRST!!!!! RENAME YOUR ORIGINAL BF2142.exe to something else. ex) BF2142a.exe
Make the installation directory your 2142 home directory, the installer will 
ask if you want to make a new folder in Program Files, that is because I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE 2124 IS INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE. CHANGE THE INSTALL FOLDER!!!! :D
i.e. c:\Program Files\EA GAMES\Battlefield 2142 Deluxe Edition\
It is important that it is in the same folder as your original BF2142.exe
or the launcher will NOT work. 

****************************************************
* Post install
******************************************************
Make sure that gameranger is pointed to the right exe. 
Join a lobby and try it out. 
If for some reason the window is tiny, resize it and click
start game. Next time you use it, it will be the right size.
(It's a bug that even with manual defaults is still appearing...)


*****************************************************
* General Info
*****************************************************
When this program runs, it will create a .bat file called launch. 
This is a shell script that launches the game with the commands 
that you input. If you delete it, it will simply create a new one next time you launch the game.
If you are uneasy about a .bat file, right click on it, select edit, and open with notepad. 
You can see for yourself exactly what it does. :)

It also puts a picture in you 2142 folder, that's just for the artwork. ;)

All code will be posted on GitHub user Mando75
url is: https://github.com/Mando75/2142

This program was built using the Qt framework for C++. 





For 2142 development
